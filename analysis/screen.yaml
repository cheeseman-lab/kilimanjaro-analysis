# Cellular Conditions
cellular:
  cell_line: "cKC774 HeLa 5k essential gene iKO library"
  imaging_timepoint: "78 hours after DOX induction"
  treatment:
    summary: "Thawed and expanded 2 days prior to induction. 78 h DOX induction. Seeded 300k cells per well in 6-well plate 24 hours before fixation"
    details: "Day 1 (2/26): Thaw cKC774 across 5 15cm plates with puro. Day 2 (2/27): Change media with puro. Day 3 (2/28): Change to DMEM + DOX at 6am. Day 4 (3/1): Seed 6-well plates 350k cells/well 48h before fixation (no DOX). Day 5 (3/2): Change media (no DOX). Day 6 (3/3): Fix at 1pm after mitotracker incubation"  # Detailed protocol or conditions

  notes: "Goals: Search factors affecting CenpT accumulation, compare mitotracker vs COXIV, analyze vimentin and ACA in HeLa cells, assess integrin B1 effects. A1 well shattered after cycle 5 - data deleted. Changed SBS settings (reduced exposure/bit depth, optimized ex/em). Don't analyze phalloidin in round 2 - signal disappeared. Cenp-T staining quality poor. Use cycle 12 for segmentation due to cycle 1 misalignment"
